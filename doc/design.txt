Fling File Transfer Protocol
============================

On copy:
  - Mark file as copied.
  - Mark timestamp when copied.

On paste:
  - Paster sends UDP broadcast: "who has copy?"
  - All copiers respond with UDP broadcast: "I have copy" and the
    amount of time that has passed since the last time the file was
    copied.
  - Paster opens TCP connection to newest copier, and copier sends to
    paster.

## What is it?
Paste File From Network is a simple, portable, peer to peer file transfer
protocol (and implementation) for a local LAN segment. The idea is to be as
simple as:

  1. Start PFFN on both computers
  2. Copy a file using PFFN on one computer.
  3. Paste the file using PFFN on the other.

See the Design for more details.

## How is PFFN Pronounced?
Well, initially we were just spelling out the acronym, but after a quick IM
session between the siblings that designed it, they decided to call it "puffin":

  * *Sister*: Well, PFFN is just about ready to test on Linux.
  * *Brother*: Eh? PFFN? Puffin?
  * *Sister*: Paste File From Network.
  * *Brother*: Oh yeah. Well, at least now you know what to call it.
  * *Brother*: And it has a logo now. :)
